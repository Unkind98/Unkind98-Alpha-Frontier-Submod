Dear, carriontrooper. I am here to report some issues that I found after deep research and testing regarding to some uniques that have trouble.
1. The conditional unique "<with [amount] to [amount] neighboring [tileFilter] [tileFilter] tiles>" seems not work for TileResoureces uniques. You can check it by using partial generation editor in Map Editor. The tested result is that the water (esp. ocean) resources will spawn in unexpected location (far away from specific related terrains).
2. The parameter for "[stat]" of the conditional unique "May buy [baseUnitFilter] units for [amount] [stat] [cityFilter] at an increasing price ([amount])" cannot be "Gold". If it is it, then, instead of using the expected amount of "[amount]", it will use the cost of "[baseUnitFilter]" as if you purchase it with gold. Also the expected increasing amount is not work too. For example: The cost amount of unbuildable unit "Hired Worker" is 70. And the policy "Construction Bureau Privatization" that have unique "May buy [Hired Worker] units for [150] [Gold] [in all cities] at an increasing price ([25])" has been picked. Now, if you want to buy "Hired Worker" It would be cost 310 Gold (modified depending on the game speed) and the price never increases as if you purchase it normally (assuming that the unit is buildable and purchasable). In short term, the given unique does not work.
That is it for now, and I will add more later.
